### QUICK EATS ( an ubereats clone)

## Using React, Redux, Styled Components, SASS, Firebase, GraphQL and more

## UPDATE

totally converted this to use typescript, chakra-ui, nextjs and firebase.  Also added hooks and testing, removed redux to use react context and connected cloudinary directly to next.js for nicer image optimization features.
