### QUICK EATS ( an ubereats clone)

## Using React, Redux, Styled Components, SASS, Firebase, GraphQL and more

## UPDATE

totally converted this to use typescript, chakra-ui, nextjs and firebase.  Also added hooks and testing, removed redux to use react context and connected cloudinary directly to next.js for nicer image optimization features.

all the pages and routes are now statically generated at build time, which makes for a much faster,and smooth web experience.  


## TODO

[ ] Write some more tests 
[ ] serverless function for sending orders ?
[ ] use stripe or some other payment api ?
[ ] forgot password function 
[ ] brainstorm ?
